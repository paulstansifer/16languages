<ul><li> The parser, slightly cleaned-up and bug-fixed, is at http://16languages.googlecode.com/svn/smalltalk/PParser.st</li>
<li> I'm working on a backend code generator for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POV-Ray">POV-Ray</a> Scene Description Language.  It's kinda a quirky language, with a lot of constructs representing graphical primitives, and the syntax is kinda complicated in weird ways.  It's actually Turing-complete, by virtue of some preprocessing commands, but it's a little bit bulky to use.  That's the reason for this project in the first place.</li>
<li> I've never really seen this, writing in accessor-full languages like Java and C++, but I guess it really is true that sometimes you want a method that, for most classes, simply returns a class variable, but for some has a "real" implementation.  Dealing with the POV-Ray SDL, there are gray areas between things that should be expressed as subclasses, and things that should be expressed with instance variables.  </li>
<li> I randomly ran into <tt>allOwners</tt>, and thought "What a ridiculous method!"  And then I figured out a use for it: a hackish way to decide whether an item of syntax (in the POV-Ray SDL) was frequently-used, and therefore should be given a name and predefined to save space.</li>

GNU Smalltalk ready
