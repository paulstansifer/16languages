I'm getting close to finished with the graphics hack, but there's a typing syntax issue that's driving me crazy.  There won't be any updates while I'm on Thanksgiving break (though hopefully there will be work done), so here's a picture of what I have so far.
<ul><li> I totally don't understand why <code>.all</code> dereferences a pointer.  It's just really strange.  </li><li> <code>.all</code> seems to be opposed to <code>.constant</code> access, which makes some sense, I guess.</li><li> I'm using examples from http://sandbox.mc.edu/~bennet/ada/examples/index.html as guides.  They're pretty good.</li><li> <code>bars2.adb:30:26: R "enames" expected</code> is the strangest error message in the world.  Is it trying to tell me to use the keyword "<code>renames</code>"?</li><li> Using aggregates instead of writing a full constructor makes banging out a lightweight class hierarchy much simpler.</li>
